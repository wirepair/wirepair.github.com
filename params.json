{"name":"wirepair's RE'ing & Security Bloggie blog","tagline":"yet another blog...","body":"### Punking PunkBuster Presentation\r\n\r\nOK folks, finally got around to releasing my slides from [44con](http://www.44con.com). Probably the most interesting part of this talk was that I decided to create my own presentation framework using [three.js](http://threejs.org). The slides themselves probably won't make much sense, so if you run a conference and want me to present at it, hit me up at [twitter](https://twitter.com/_wirepair).\r\n\r\nI got glowing reviews such as \"doesn't suck\" and \"only drooled a little.\" As such, I believe it to be a pretty entertaining talk for most attendees.\r\n\r\nUse the left/right arrow keys to transition from slides. No, you can't transition during an animation, so wait for it to finish. Check out the slides hosted thanks to github!\r\n\r\n[Punking PunkBuster By Isaac Dawson](http://wirepair.github.com/pbslides/slides.html)\r\n\r\nIf you want just the framework check out my [ThreePrez](https://github.com/wirepair/ThreePrez/) repository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
