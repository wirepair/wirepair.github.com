Probably the most interesting part of this talk was that I decided to create my own presentation framework using [three.js](http://threejs.org). The slides them selves won't make much sense, so if you run a conference and want me to present at it, hit me up at [twitter](https://twitter.com/_wirepair).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse the left/right arrow keys to transition from slides. Now you can't transition during an animation, so wait for it to finish. Check out the slides hosted thanks to github!\r\n\r\n[Punking PunkBuster By Isaac Dawson](http://wirepair.github.com/pbslides/slides.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
